This repository contains open training materials from Mộc Lan Anh.

The core content is currently published in Vietnamese,
as it reflects the native context in which these field cases emerged.

Readers are invited to engage at their own pace.

### Multi-language Strategy
Technical specifications are published in three languages:

- 🇬🇧 English (.en) - International collaborators
- 🇻🇳 Vietnamese (.vi) - Local implementation partners

### Documentation Philosophy
We maintain levels of transparency:
- **Public**: Professional documentation suitable for partners and community

"Viết thực tế mà ko che lấp" (Write reality without hiding) - but with appropriate context for each audience.
